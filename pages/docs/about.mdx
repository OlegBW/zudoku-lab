The **Ticketing System API** allows you to manage events and tickets efficiently. This SDK client was generated using the OpenAPI specification, ensuring smooth integration with the Ticketing System API. It provides easy-to-use methods for interacting with events and tickets, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting events and tickets.

### Key Features:

- **Events**: Retrieve a list of events, create new events, update existing events, or delete events.
- **Tickets**: View available tickets, create new tickets, update ticket details, or delete tickets.

The OpenAPI document and the SDK were uploaded to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for version control. You can access and contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/OlegBW/openapi-lab).
